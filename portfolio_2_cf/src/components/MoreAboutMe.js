      <h3>I have completed a B.S. in Biology,  training my scientific mind while using my work ethic and outside-the-box analytical thinking to solve problems. I have supplemented my Bachelorâ€™s degree with a software engineering training certificate.  My scientific mind injects intellectual curiosity and creativity into software engineering.  I have strong communication, collaboration and multi-tasking skills. I am looking for an entry level job to combine the two skill sets I have built over the years.</h3>

      <p className='cardParagraph'>Video Games are something I have always loved, ranging from computer games to xbox games and switch games. The first games I started with were Age of Mythology for PC and Pokemon for Game Boy Color. I moved on to Call Of Duty and Halo, then to FIFA. Recently I have been playing Mario Kart on my switch and am very close to beating the game on all difficulties.</p>

The image cover for this card is of Magellan's fleet, he was the first person to travel around the world completely, and I am currently reading a history book about him and his adventure. </p>

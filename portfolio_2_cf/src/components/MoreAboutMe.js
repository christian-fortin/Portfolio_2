The first games I started with were Age of Mythology for PC and Pokemon for Game Boy Color. I moved on to Call Of Duty and Halo, then to FIFA.

                times a year. My best friend and I are very good and like to
                do the hardest stuff on the mountains and sometimes even go
                helicopter skiing.
